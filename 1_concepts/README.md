# Quantum Programming Concepts

<img src="https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-quantum/blob/main/1_concepts/images/bloch.png" width=200 align=right>

QPUs or quantum processor units which act on qubits are the units of computation for quantum programs.  There are a number of core concepts associated with QPUs and qubits. 
- A [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere), shown to the right is usually used to visualize the state(s) of the associated qubits when running a quantum program.

- The north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors ∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩ on the Z-axis.

## Quantum Computing Languages and Libraries

- There are a growing nubmer of quantum computing languages and libraries.    
- Many of these languages are designed to run on a particular vendor's environment.    
- This includes offerings from public cloud vendors - see this [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-quantum/blob/main/CLOUD-VENDORS.md)
