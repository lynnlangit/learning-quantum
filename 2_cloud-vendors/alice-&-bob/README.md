# Alice & Bob Cloud Quantum Computing

## Accessing the Service
To access the cloud quantum computing service on the GCP Marketplace, please visit the website at [Alice & Bob Quantum](https://alice-bob.com/products/quantum-cloud-felis/).  
Here, you can sign up for an account, explore documentation, and start running your quantum algorithms on state-of-the-art quantum processors.  

*"Felis is the software solution developed by Alice & Bob to experiment with its core technology, cat qubits.
It is based on Qiskit, the most popular quantum computing framework."*

## Supported Quantum Algorithms
Our service supports a wide range of quantum algorithms, including:
- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
- Grover's Search Algorithm
- Shor's Factoring Algorithm
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

See Jupyter notebook samples on Github at [link](https://github.com/Alice-Bob-SW/felis/tree/main/samples)
