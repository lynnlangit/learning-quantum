## Major Breakthroughs (2024-2025)

### Majorana 1 - Topological Quantum Processor (February 2025)
**GROUNDBREAKING: World's First Topological Quantum Chip**

Microsoft unveiled Majorana 1, the world's first quantum processing unit powered by topological qubits - a fundamentally different approach to quantum computing.

**Key Features:**
- First quantum processor powered by **topological qubits**
- Uses revolutionary **"topoconductor"** materials (world's first)
- Designed to scale to **1 million qubits on a single chip**
- **Hardware-protected** qubits with intrinsic error suppression
- Small, fast, and digitally controlled qubits
- Research published in **Nature** (February 2025)

**Technical Innovation:**
- Combines indium arsenide (semiconductor) with aluminum (superconductor)
- Creates **Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs)** at near absolute zero temperatures
- Qubits store information through electron **parity** (even/odd electron count)
- MZMs shared between wire ends make quantum information "invisible" to environment
- Digitally controlled via quantum dots for readout

**What Makes This Different:**
Unlike conventional qubits (superconducting, ion trap, etc.), topological qubits are inherently protected from certain types of errors at the hardware level. This could dramatically reduce the overhead required for error correction.

**Roadmap:**
- **2025**: Majorana 1 prototype demonstration
- **2026-2028**: Scaling topological qubit arrays
- **Goal**: Build fault-tolerant prototype (FTP) based on topological qubits - years ahead of original timeline
