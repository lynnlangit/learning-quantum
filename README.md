# Learning Cloud Quantum Programming

<img src="https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-quantum/blob/main/images/bit-vs-qubit.png" width=375 align=left>

This repo contains my study resources for learning **cloud quantum programming**.    

Shown to the left is a conceptual rendering of a bit vs a qubit, which is a fundamental concept of work in quantum computing.  The Repo is a companion to my LI_L course ["Cloud Quantum Computing Essentials"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cloud-quantum-computing-essentials)

A **qubit** is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics. A quantum computer performs quantum computations using the principles of quantum mechanics.   

A **QPU** (quantum processing units) manipulates the quantum states of available qubits in a controlled way to perform computations, such as algorithms. A qubit is a quantum bit of information.  

A **quantum computer** contains QPU processors, some number of qubits and the support mechanisms which allow these items to interact based on quantum instructions or programs.

## Quantum Computer Example

<img src="https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-quantum/blob/main/images/d-wave-hardware.png" width=600 align=right>

There are a number of quantum computer vendors.  These vendors produce hardware (quantum computers) which contains a particular number of qubits and QPUs.   

One example is the [D-Wave](https://www.dwavesys.com/) company.  Shown to the right are photos from one of D-Wave's quantum computers.  This computer contains QPU units, which is hardware with qubits (image taken from D-Wave whitepaper). To run quantum programs on quantum hardware, use quantum languages or libraries.    

NOTE: Generally quantum programs are run on quantum simulators prior to being run on quantum hardware due to the cost and time run on live QPUs.

## Quantum Programs and IDEs

Shown below are screenshots from a couple of quantum programming development environments.  This is just a small subset of the available options.  Generally these IDEs are either cloud-based (IBM Composer) or downloadable via a SDK (D-Wave).  

- The first example (shown below) shows running a quantum program in the IBM Quantum Composer IDE.  This example runs the `Grover-example` quantum program. The visual environment includes the composer, which shows quantum operations written in the OPENQASM quantum programming language and a number of other visualization tools.

- The second example (shown below) is from from D-Wave Systems cloud at https://cloud.dwavesys.com/ and is being run using VSCode as an IDE.  The sample shows a path optimization solver and is called `path` in the D-Wave examples. The program is written using the D-Wave Python-like quantum programming library. This IDE is a more traditional environment and doesn't include as many visualization tools for the state of the qubits used in computation.

## Resources for Learning

- Yet another example of a quantum program visualization tools is the browser-based `Quantum Playground` - http://www.quantumplayground.net/.  Shown below is an example of animated output using the H gate example code.  This is a particularly good tool for gaining an intuition into key quantum operations and program examples.
